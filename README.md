I want to build a web app that mirrors the exact official documents required for Canadian PR applications, but in a much more accessible way.
The app displays the original form layout without altering its structure. When the user clicks a flag icon in the corner, they can select their own language, and the form is translated into their language while visually remaining identical to the original document.
If the user encounters terms that do not exist in their country or cultural background (for example, common-law), they can click directly on the word. A small tooltip / info bubble appears, explaining what that term means in simple language.
Users can fill out the form directly inside the app.
Another example:
For questions like “Countries you have lived in during the last 5 years”, the user can click a small AI help icon at the bottom right of the page. Through this AI support, they can write the countries in their own language, learn the correct English equivalents, and then automatically insert them into the form fields.
Even while the user is filling out the form, the document continues to appear in their chosen language.
Once the entire form is completed, the app converts everything back to the original English version, allowing the user to download and submit the final document as a PDF.
The goal is to help newcomers who do not speak English well and who struggle with legal or cultural terms that may not exist in their home countries. Through this web app, they can complete their PR forms quickly, accurately, and without needing to leave the platform.
Additionally, since the app is AI-powered, users can ask questions like “What happens if I enter incorrect information?” and receive clear answers within the same app, without searching elsewhere.
